    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This wikipedia page is about the very special person, my mentor, guider, leader, If I say that he is angel to all
        mankind then I wouldn't be wrong.
        He has changed lives of many people through his motivational videos,speeches, seminars. He is none other than
        Sandeep Maheshwari. I have been watching his videos
        since 2017 and I learned many things across all fields of life. His guidance, teachings helped me to
        live my life in a much better way than before. He also faced many obstacles, struggles, problems, hurdles,
        difficulties in his own life. His self esteem was very low at that point
        of time, he used to be bullied alot at his school. He was a kind of shy boy who used to feel hesitation while
        meeting and talking to other people. He was a kind of introvert person. He didn't loose hope. He used His
        will power at that time to face all the challenges of life and be strong physically, mentally, spiritually,
        emotionally. He started making fun of himself, when he started doing this, people stopped making fun of him.
        He is a undergraduate, he also used to moked upon this but he himself made fun by saying I am even undergraduate
        he started laughing at his own. H e failed many times but didn't loose hope. He did many businesses but failed
        , he rose again and followed his passion and opened a small company of ImagesBazar as he was interested in
        photography which has now the world's largest indian photography website. His journey inspired many youths.
        thank you sir!... </p>




    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <h3>When and where he was born</h3>
    <p>Sandeep Maheshwari was born on 28 September 1980 in New Delhi, India. He is an Indian entrepreneur, photographer,
        and motivational speaker. He is the founder and CEO of ImagesBazaar, a stock photo agency that has over a
        million
        images.</p>
    <h3>Family background</h3>
    <p>Sandeep Maheshwari comes from a middle-class family. His father was a businessman, and his mother was a
        homemaker. He has a younger sister. Sandeep's family has always supported his dreams and aspirations.</p>


    <h2>Career</h2>
    <h3>Struggles in early life</h3>
    <p>He was so low in self-esteem at that point of time that his positive thoughts used to be overpowered by
        negatives. 11th standard was the turning point of his when he met Neha (his wife).

        They both became friends and their trust in each other grew with time. After 12th, he starts his graduation at
        Kirori Mal College, but he could not complete his graduation because of some personal issues.

        The financial condition of his family was not good when he was just in the 9th standard. After the 12th exam, he
        started his first business as a Help Center to help 12th pass out students to choose their career and print many
        pamphlets with the title "What to do after 12th?"

        For this, he tied up with an institute called NIS- National Institute of Sales and Marketing. NIS offered
        Sandeep 20% commission if he referred the program of NIS to someone else.

        At NIS there were role plays, GD, presentations, and debates. It helped him interact with more and master his
        skills that helped him a lot in the long run. As a young man, Sandeep initially joined his family's aluminium
        business that later collapsed. To support his family financially, Sandeep started doing everything he could,
        from joining a marketing agency to manufacturing and marketing household products.

        This period, he drops out of college and embarks on the journey of learning the subject of 'life'.

        He was just 19 year old when he his career as a model. But he got disappointed a lot due to the rampant
        harassment and exploitation in the .

        Because of his negative experience, he decided to do something and bring positive change in the modelling.

        And, he started working as a freelance photographer to support aspiring models. Later, he established his own
        company named Mash Audio Visuals Pvt. Ltd and used to make portfolios.</p>

    <h3>Creation of ImagesBazaar</h3>
    <p>In 2002, he along with his three friends started a new company but that did not thrive and was eventually shut
        down. But Sandeep was not ready to stop, in 2003; he wrote a book on marketing and came up with a consultancy
        firm.

        Here, he again failed and have to return to photography. The same year, he created a world record by taking more
        than 10,000 shots of 122 models in 10 hours and 45 minutes.

        In 2006, he took the foundation of ImagesBazaar. That time, it was a small idea; he was multitasking that time
        and worked as a photographer, telecaller, and counsellor by himself. His journey continued and he began
        measuring the success path.

        Now, ImagesBazaar has become the largest hub of Indian pictures in the world, with over one million images and
